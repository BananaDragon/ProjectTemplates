Adobe AIR Native Extension Template
================

Currently sets up Android platform, Default platform and the Public ActionScript Interface.
TODO: 
- Add "wizard" application for easy changing of extension name etc. (currently hardcoded everywhere to com.bananadragon.extension)
- Add iOS build template for the ANE as well.
